This is a basic video bot written in PHP meant to be used via CLI, some usage examples are:

    php bot.php --file="/path/to/source.mp4" --dest="/base/path/to/destination" --mode=delete --conflict=delete

The base destination will have two folders created, TV Shows and Movies and the files will accordingly be sorted in there. TV Shows will be sorted
into TV Shows/Series name/Season #/Episode title.ext format, Movies will be stored as Movies/Title (year).ext format. 

I created it to automatically sort my torrent downloads into TV Shows and Movies folder respectively, perhaps you can find some similar use for it.

A lot of work is still required in handling of multi-part episodes, better detection of episode's season, episode number and title, 
perhaps subtitle fetching and some more features.

Inspired from filebot, but since it was written in Java I couldn't use it in Raspberry Pi efficiently. Uses The Movie DB and The TV DB, open source
databases for storing movies and TV episode's information. Uses open source libraries for their handling
